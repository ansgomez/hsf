CONFIGURATION:

1. Change line 3 of hsf_paths to the location of your HSF
folder (by default it's in ~/git/HSF). 

2. In the terminal, type:
     
     source hsf_paths.sh

This will set a new $HSF variable, and add it to your $PATH variable. 
You can also add it to you ~/.bashrc file.

3. Then type:
     ./install.sh

4. Run HSF!
   you can now type in you terminal the following commands:
   
   sudo hsf [filename(.xml)]
   simulate [filename(.xml)]
   calculate [metric] [filename]
   show [metric] [filename]
   simfig [filename]
   publish [filename]
