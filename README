REQUIREMENTS:

   HSF requires a *NIX kernel with standard libraries. To compile
   all sources, these packages are needed:
   
     g++
     make
     octave
     php
     libmgl-dev
     libX11-dev

  Mathgl library should be compiled, and libmgl.so.7.0.0 should be
  placed in /usr/local/lib (otherwise the MATHGL variable in the makefile 
  should be changed to the appriopiate location. For more information 
  on Mathgl, please visit:
  
     http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/

CONFIGURATION:

1. If you HSF folder is not located in ~/git, then please change 
   line 3 of hsf_paths to the path to your HSF folder

2. In the terminal, type:
     
         source hsf_paths.sh
   
   This will set a new $HSF variable, and add it to your $PATH variable. 
   You can also add it to you ~/.bashrc file, to have it load automatically
   
   You need root privileges to execute hsf.

3. Then type:

         ./install.sh

4. Run HSF!

   You can now type in you terminal the following commands:
   
     sudo hsf [filename(.xml)]
     simulate [filename(.xml)]
     calculate [metric] [filename]
     show [metric] [filename]
     simfig [filename]
     publish [filename]
   
     [metric] can be one (or more) of the following:
   
       exe|exec     ->  Execution Times
       resp         ->  Response Times
       throughput   ->  Throughput
       util         ->  Utilization
       alloc        ->  Resource allocation costs
       sys          ->  System allocation costs
       worker       ->  Worker costs
       missed       ->  Missed deadlines
