REQUIREMENTS:

   HSF requires a *NIX kernel with standard libraries. To compile
   all sources, these packages are needed:
   
     g++
     make
     octave
     php
     libmgl-dev
     libX11-dev

  Mathgl library should be compiled, and libmgl.so.7.0.0 should be
  placed in /usr/local/lib (otherwise the MATHGL variable in the makefile 
  should be changed to the appriopiate location. For more information 
  on Mathgl, please visit:
  
     http://mathgl.sourceforge.net/

CONFIGURATION:

1. If you HSF folder is not located in ~/git, then please change 
   line 3 of hsf_paths.sh to the path of your HSF folder

2. In the terminal, type:
     
         source hsf_paths.sh
   
   This will set a new $HSF variable, and add it to your $PATH variable. 
   You can also add it to you ~/.bashrc file, to have it load automatically
   
   You need root privileges to execute hsf. On some older systems, you might have
   to add the following line to your bash profile in order to inherit you PATH 
   variable when using 'sudo':
         
         alias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PATH $@' 

3. Then type:

         ./install.sh

4. Run HSF!

   You can now type in you terminal the following commands:
   
     sudo hsf [filename(.xml)]
     simulate [filename(.xml)]
     calculate [metric] [filename]
     show [metric] [filename]
     simfig [filename]
     publish [filename]
   
     [metric] can be one (or more) of the following:
   
       exe|exec     ->  Execution Times
       resp         ->  Response Times
       throughput   ->  Throughput
       util         ->  Utilization
       alloc        ->  Resource allocation costs
       sys          ->  System allocation costs
       worker       ->  Worker costs
       missed       ->  Missed deadlines
